This is a Password Generator for creating a random password based on the user's request for length and character type choices.

    The length must be between 8 and 128 characters and may contain the following:

       * Special characters

       * Numeric characters

       * Lowercase characters

       * Uppercase characters

    The user may pick one or all 4 character types.

 This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

The application validates user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered and the user clicks the Generate Password button, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts.
